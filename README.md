# CAV-Anomalies-Detection

Models being used- CNN-LSTM Autoencoder and CNN-BiLSTM. 
Experimentation are done for D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder, MSD-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder, D-CNN-BiLSTM, MSD-CNN-BiLSTM.
Experimentation are done using two different approachs Independent and MultiChannel. 
Experimentation are done using two new data preprocessing Differencing(D) and Moving Standard Deviation (MSD).
