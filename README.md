# CAV-Anomalies-Detection
There is the dataset in this link: https://github.com/next-generation-mobility-systems-lab/CAV-Sensor-Anomaly-Detection-Dataset

Models being used- CNN-LSTM Autoencoder and CNN-BiLSTM. 
Experimentation are done for D-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder, MSD-CNN-LSTM Autoencoder, D-CNN-BiLSTM, MSD-CNN-BiLSTM.
Experimentation are done using two different approachs Independent and MultiChannel. 
Experimentation are done using two new data preprocessing Differencing(D) and Moving Standard Deviation (MSD).
